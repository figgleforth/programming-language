# Runs every examples/*.code file end to end and asserts none of them raise -- these are meant to be
# runnable teaching examples (see .claude/CLAUDE.md's examples/ doc style notes), so a file that
# errors out is a broken lesson, not just a broken test. One generated test method per file,
# rather than one test looping over all of them, so a failure names exactly which file broke
# instead of stopping at the first one.
