# The Advent of Code solutions in guides/aoc/ crunch real puzzle input and are slow (day 4 brute-forces
# MD5, day 6 touches ~20M grid cells), so they don't run in a normal `rake test`. Each file ends in an
# `answer == expected` expression, so `interp_file` returning truthy = solved.
#
#   AOC=1 rake test          -- run them
#   AOC=1 ruby test/advent_of_code_test.rb
#
# As more days get solved (and as the language gets faster), un-comment / add lines below.
