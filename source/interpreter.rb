		# Parsed ASTs by resolved filepath, kept class-level (not per-instance) for the same reason: `source/programs/global.code` (and everything it transitively @loads) is immutable source, identical for every Interpreter in the process, so re-lexing/re-parsing it fresh on every `Code.interp` call was pure waste -- it used to be instance-level, meaning a brand-new Interpreter (which every `Code.interp` call constructs) never saw a warm cache. Doesn't cache the *interpretation* of that AST (each Interpreter still builds its own fresh Standard_Library scope from it), only the lex+parse step, so per-instance isolation (mutating a builtin in one test can't leak into another) is unaffected.
		cache_by_path :cached_expressions_by_filepath # {filepath: [Code::Expression]}

		# Resolved filepaths whose AST has already passed type-checking at least once, kept class-level alongside the cache above. Type-checking is a pure function of the AST (no interpreter state involved) -- a cached, never-changing file that already passed once will always pass, so re-walking it on every subsequent load is pure waste, same as re-parsing was.
		cache_by_path :type_checked_filepaths # {filepath: true}

		# Raw source of runtime assets injected into every matching response (dom.js, view_transition.css) -- not Code source, so it never goes through the lex/parse caches above.
