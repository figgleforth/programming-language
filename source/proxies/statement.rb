module Code
	# Code wrapper for `*_Expr < Expression`. Built two ways:
	# 1. A backtick literal (`` `expr` ``) -- Interpreter#interp_statement builds this directly and
	#    sets captured_scope, since only interpreter-side code has a stack to read from.
	# 2. `Statement(...)` -- goes through the normal Type-construction path, so #initialize only ever
	#    sees a throwaway arg (same as every Ruby-backed Code type, e.g. Code::String/Code::Array); real
	#    argument binding happens in source/code/statement.code's `Self(;)` instead.

		# Scope on top of the stack when this was built from a backtick literal -- mirrors
		# Code::Func#enclosing_scope's closure trick. Set only by Interpreter#interp_statement; nil
		# otherwise, and Interpreter#invoke_statement then falls back to use_caller_scope behavior.
		#
		# use_caller_scope/memoize/memoized/_memoized_value live in source/code/statement.code as ordinary Code
		# members instead (so plain dot-assignment works); read/written from Ruby via Scope#[]/#[]=.
