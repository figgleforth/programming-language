Learn about the language below, or [in the learn section](examples/readme.md), or *[click here to get started using it](source/readme.md)*.

## Variables

1. Must start with a lowercase letter or `_`.
2. Can end with `!` or `?`

```code
nothing := nil
something: Number = 123
_private_thing := "Yes"
tested? := false
```

## Functions

1. Must start with a lowercase letter or `_`
2. The function body is surrounded with `()` parens
3. The arguments are declared before the arguments/body delimiter `;`
4. The body comes after the arguments/body delimiter `;`
5. The last expression is the return value
6. Return early using `return` keyword

```code
# func_name ( [args]; [body] )

func_with_args ( arg1, arg2 := 1, etc := true;
    # body
)

without_args (;
    # body
)

add ( a, b;
    a + b
)
add(4, 8)  # 12

_privately_do ( x, y, z; )

# A call whose single argument is an anonymous function may drop that argument's parens,
# when the receiver is a member access / call / subscript:
[1, 2, 3].map(n; n * 2)     # == [1, 2, 3].map((n; n * 2))
```

## Labeled & Named Function Arguments

**Labels** — a param declared as two identifiers in a row (`label name`) can be called `label: value`. Matches by position, never reorders. Opt-in per call; wrong label raises `Argument_Label_Mismatch`.

```code
send_message ( to person, saying text;
    "To `person`: `text`"
)

send_message(to: 'Jack', saying: 'Found fresh water')  # positional and labeled both work
send_message('Sayid', 'Meet at the caves')
```

**Named arguments** — `name := value` at a call site binds by the callee's declared param name, order-independent. Positional args (bare or labeled) must come first; once you name one, the rest must be named too.

```code
sub ( a, b; a - b )

sub(a := 1, b := 2)   # -1
sub(b := 2, a := 1)   # -1 reordered, same result
sub(1, b := 2)        # -1 positional then named is fine

# sub(a := 1, 2)       raises Positional_Argument_After_Named
# sub(a := 1, a := 2)  raises Duplicate_Named_Argument
# sub(a := 1, c := 2)  raises Unknown_Named_Argument
# sub(1, a := 2)       raises Argument_Given_By_Name_And_Position
```

**Struct-typed params** — `: <...>` instead of a plain type name checks *structurally*, not by name: any argument that has each listed member, with a compatible type, is accepted. `Any` matches any member type. Checked on every call, raising `Type_Contract_Violation` on a mismatch.

```code
f ( right: <name: String, type: Any, value: Any>; right.name )

m := Member('x', String, 4)
f(m)     # 'x' -- Member isn't named in the annotation, it just has all three members
f(nil)   # raises Type_Contract_Violation
```

## Recursion

A named function is registered in its enclosing scope as it's declared, so it can call itself.

```code
factorial ( n;
    if n == 0 or n == 1
        1
    else
        n * factorial(n - 1)
    end
)
factorial(8)  # 40320

fib ( n;
    if n <= 1
        n
    else
        fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)
    end
)
fib(10)  # 55

fizz_buzz ( n;
    if n % 15 == 0
        'FizzBuzz'
    elif n % 3 == 0
        'Fizz'
    elif n % 5 == 0
        'Buzz'
    else
        n.to_s()
    end
)

for 1..15
    @puts fizz_buzz(it)
end
```

## Forward Declarations

Calling a function, or referencing a type, works even before its own declaration is reached in the file — including mutual recursion between two functions declared in either order.

```code
result := main()   # `main` hasn't been declared yet, but this still works

main (; helper() )
helper (; 42 )

result  # 42
```

```code
is_even ( n;
    if n == 0
        true
    else
        is_odd(n - 1)
    end
)

is_odd ( n;
    if n == 0
        false
    else
        is_even(n - 1)
    end
)

is_even(4)  # true
```

A class-styled alias (`This := That {}`) hoists the same way, since it's declaring a type just spelled through an assignment:

```code
p := This()

This := That {}
That { greet (; 'hi' ) }

p.greet()  # 'hi'
```

A bare `@load` hoists too, so imports can live at the bottom of the file instead of the top:

```code
sign := Div([P('hi')])
sign.to_s()  # '<div><p>hi</p></div>'

@load 'programs/html.code'
```

`Ident := @load 'file'` / `IDENT := @load 'file'` work the same way — only a Capitalized or UPPERCASE left-hand name opts in, since that's what marks it as a namespace rather than an ordinary variable:

```code
sign := Html_Lib.Div([Html_Lib.P('hi')])
sign.to_s()  # '<div><p>hi</p></div>'

Html_Lib := @load 'programs/html.code'

# html_lib := @load 'programs/html.code'   -- lowercase stays a plain variable, not hoisted
```

Plain variable assignments are never hoisted this way — reading one before its own line has actually run still raises `Undeclared_Identifier`, same as any language with top-to-bottom execution:

```code
@puts "`a`"   # raises Undeclared_Identifier
a := 123
```

## Classes

1. Must start with an uppercase character
2. Can have an initializer `Self`

```code
My_Class {
    input,
    
    Self ( input;
        self.input = input  # self is the current instance, like this in other languages
        @puts 'Initted with "`input`"'
    )
}

instance := My_Class('some input')  # Initted with "some input"
```

## Constants

1. Must be UPPERCASE
2. Cannot be reassigned after initial declaration

```code
PI := 3.14159
MAX_SIZE := 100
APP_NAME := 'My App'
```

## Comments

```code
# This is a single-line comment
# Stack a few of these for a multi-line comment

###
Or wrap a whole block in ###/### -- everything in between is discarded,
including lines of code, so it doubles as a way to comment out code.
###

####
A longer run of #s on the outer marker can safely nest a same-length
or shorter ### inside it, since only a marker at least as long as the
opening one closes the block -- the same rule ``` fences use to nest.
### this looks like a comment but it's just text in here ###
still inside the outer comment
####
```

## String Interpolation

1. Use backticks inside strings to interpolate expressions
2. Escape with backslash to prevent interpolation

```code
name := 'World'
greeting := "Hello, `name`!"  # "Hello, World!"
math := "2 + 2 = `2 + 2`"    # "2 + 2 = 4"
escaped := "Literal \`backticks\`"
```

## Scope Keywords

`self`, `Self`, and `Global` are bare scope keywords — each is a value on its own, and `Keyword.member` reaches one name in exactly that scope, no outward search:

1. `self` — the current instance only
2. `Self` — the current type only (where statics live)
3. `Global` — the global scope only

```code
My_Class {
    Self.count := 0   # Type-level (static) variable
    value,

    Self ( value;
        self.value = value   # Instance variable (like this.value in other languages)
        Self.count += 1      # Access static from instance
    )

    get_global (;
        Global.PI  # reach a global constant past any local shadow
    )
}
```

## Static Declarations

1. Use `Self.` to declare type-level (static) members
2. Shared across all instances
3. Accessed on the type itself: `Type.member`

```code
Counter {
    Self.count := 0

    Self.increment (;
        count += 1
    )

    Self (;
        Self.count += 1
    )
}

Counter()
Counter()
Counter.count  # 2
```

## Type Composition

1. `|` union: merge all members from both types
2. `&` intersection: keep only shared members
3. `~` removal: remove members of right type from left
4. `^` symmetric difference: keep non-shared members

These four meanings only apply to an actual `Type | Other { }` composition. A `: Type` annotation (`x: Int | Nil`) reuses the same four symbols to mean plain OR, whichever one is written — see [Runtime Type Contracts](#runtime-type-contracts).

```code
Movable {
    x := 0
    y := 0
    move ( dx, dy;
        x += dx
        y += dy
    )
}

Drawable {
    color := 'black'
    draw (; "Drawing in `color`" )
}

# Combine types
Sprite | Movable | Drawable {
    name := 'sprite'
}

s := Sprite()
s.move(10, 5)
s.draw()
```

Composition chains, so `~` can remove a trait that was mixed in earlier in the same chain:

```code
Flying { can_fly := true }
Swimming { can_swim := true }

Duck | Flying | Swimming { name := 'duck' }
d := Duck()
d.can_fly     # true
d.can_swim    # true

Ostrich | Duck ~ Flying { name := 'ostrich' }
o := Ostrich()
o.can_swim    # true
o.can_fly     # raises Code::Undeclared_Identifier
```

A type can even compose with itself, to extend or override a built-in type's own behavior:

```code
Array | Array {
    each ( func;
        for self.values   # self.values reaches the original Array's own values, despite `each` itself now being redefined
            func(it)
        end
    )
}

values := Array([1, 2, 3])
doubled := []
values.each(( it;
    doubled.push(it * 2)
))
doubled  # [2, 4, 6]
```

A [struct](#structs) value works as a composition operand too — its named members compose in as ordinary members:

```code
p := <a := 5, b := 'x'>

Combined | p {
    foo (; a )
}

c := Combined()
c.a       # 5
c.b       # 'x'
c.foo()   # 5
```

(An unnamed struct member — `<String, Number>` — has no name to compose in under, so it doesn't transfer.)

In a chain, the *leftmost* operand that declares a given member wins a name collision — including `Self`, the constructor:

```code
A { Self (; self.label := 'A' ) }
B { Self (; self.label := 'B' ) }

Combined | A | B {}
Combined().label   # 'A' -- A's Self ran, not B's; A comes first in the chain
```

A type's own `{}` body always wins over anything pulled in by composition, no matter where in the chain — so an explicit `Self (;)` in the body itself beats every composed-in one.

### Alias vs. subtype

There are two ways to give a type a second name, and they behave differently under the [type comparison operators](#comparison):

```code
Whole | Integer {}    # subtype — Whole is a NEW type that composes Integer
Int32 := Integer      # alias   — Int32 IS Integer, the same type object

4 === Integer          # true
4 === Int32            # true   (alias — identical composed-type set)
4 === Whole            # false  (subtype — 4's set is {Integer, Number}; Whole adds itself)

Whole  =>= Integer     # true   (a Whole is-a Integer)
Integer =>= Whole      # false  (not every Integer is a Whole)
```

Use `:=` when you just want a synonym (`Int := Integer` in the standard library); use `| {}` when the new name should be a distinct, narrower type that `=>=` its parent but isn't `===` to it.

## Conditionals

1. `if`/`elif`/`else`/`end`
2. `unless` is the negation of `if`
3. Can be used as inline modifiers
4. Any value works as a condition -- truthiness follows Ruby's own rules: only `nil`/`false` are falsy, everything else (`0`/`0.0` included) is truthy

```code
if x > 10
    'big'
elif x > 5
    'medium'
else
    'small'
end

unless logged_in
    redirect('/login')
end

# Inline conditionals
@puts 'yes' if condition
@puts 'no' unless condition
```

## While & Until Loops

1. `while` loops while condition is true
2. `until` loops until condition becomes true
3. `elwhile` chains another loop when prior condition becomes false

```code
i := 0
while i < 5
    @puts i
    i += 1
end

j := 0
until j == 5
    @puts j
    j += 1
end

# Chained loops with elwhile
x := 0
y := 0
while x < 4
    x += 1
elwhile y > -8
    y -= 1
else
    @puts 'done'
end
```

## For Loops

1. Iterate over arrays, ranges, or any iterable
2. `it` is the current element
3. `at` is the current index

```code
for [1, 2, 3]
    @puts it      # Current element
    @puts at      # Current index
end

for 1..5
    @puts it      # 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
end

# With stride (chunks)
for [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] by 2
    @puts it      # [1,2], [3,4], [5,6]
end
```

## For Loop Verbs

1. `map` transforms each element
2. `select` filters where body is truthy
3. `reject` filters where body is falsy
4. `count` counts where body is truthy

```code
doubled := for [1, 2, 3] map
    it * 2
end  # [2, 4, 6]

evens := for [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] select
    it % 2 == 0
end  # [2, 4]

odds := for [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] reject
    it % 2 == 0
end  # [1, 3, 5]

even_count := for [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] count
    it % 2 == 0
end  # 3
```

`by <stride>,<overlap>` slides each window forward by `stride - overlap` elements instead of a full `stride`, so consecutive windows share `overlap` elements instead of being disjoint:

```code
pairs := for [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] map by 2,1   # stride 2, sliding forward by 1
    (it.0, it.?1)
end  # [(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 6), (6, nil)] -- every consecutive pair, plus a trailing short window

windows := for [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] map by 3,1   # stride 3, sliding forward by 2
    (it.0, it.?1, it.?2)
end  # [(1, 2, 3), (3, 4, 5), (5, 6, 7), (7, nil, nil)] -- each window shares 1 element with the next
```

A trailing window that can't reach the full `stride` is kept short instead of dropped, same as the plain no-overlap form above. Use `.?N` (not `.N`) past index 0 when reading a window's elements, since only the first element is guaranteed to exist. `overlap` must be a smaller integer than `stride`.

## Loop Control

1. `skip` continues to next iteration
2. `stop` breaks out of loop
3. `return` exits the function (propagates through loops)

```code
for items
    skip if it.this     # Continue to next
    stop if it.that     # Break out
end

find_first ( predicate;
    for items
        return it if predicate(it)
    end
    nil
)
```

## Splatting a Scope

Every scope keeps two extra fallback places identifier lookup checks, after its own declarations — a **read-only** set and a **writable** set (also a fallback for writes) — making an instance's members reachable without an `instance.` prefix. Lookup order is always `[self, writable, read-only]`: a scope's own declarations win first.

1. `@splat x` unpacks `x` as a writable splat; `@splatr x` read-only; `@unsplat x` removes it. Works on a function param (the common case) or by hand anywhere.
2. A `: Type` / `: <...>` annotation on a splat param *is* enforced at the call — pass the wrong shape and you get a `Type_Contract_Violation` right there, not an `Undeclared_Identifier` deep in the body.
3. Both sets are held *weakly* — a splatted instance isn't kept alive; once nothing else refers to it it's collectible on its own, so `@unsplat` is only for cutting something off early, not for avoiding a leak.
4. The standard library lives this way — `String`/`Array`/etc. are reachable through Global's own read-only splat, not declared on Global directly. Reassigning a built-in (`Array = Mine`) can't mutate the real one; it just shadows the name for the rest of your program.

```code
Vector {
    x := 0
    y := 0
}

# Auto-unpack in a parameter
magnitude ( @splatr vec;
    (x ** 2 + y ** 2).sqrt()  # x, y resolve directly
)

v := Vector()
v.x = 3
v.y = 4
magnitude(v)  # 5

# @splat (writable) lets a plain write reach the unpacked instance's own member
double ( @splat vec;
    x *= 2   # writes straight through to vec.x
    y *= 2
    vec
)
doubled := double(v)  # doubled.x: 6, doubled.y: 8

# By hand, anywhere
@splatr some_instance
@unsplat some_instance
```

```code
# The standard library works the same way -- Array is reachable through
# Global's own read-only splat, not declared on Global directly
Mine | Array { extra := true }
Array = Mine          # shadows the name -- the real Array is untouched
[1, 2, 3].length()    # 3 -- still works, Mine composes Array
[1].extra              # true -- and every array literal now has this too
```

An unpacked instance stays visible to functions defined after the unpack, even nested ones:

```code
Point {
    a := 0
    b := 0

    Self ( a, b;
        self.a = a
        self.b = b
    )
}

outer (;
    p := Point(23, 42)
    @splatr p

    inner (;
        a + b   # a, b resolved from p via the splat, despite being nested inside outer
    )

    inner()
)
outer()  # 65
```

## Reopening Scopes (`@push_scope`/`@pop_scope`)

1. `@push_scope <Type or instance>` pushes that scope directly onto the stack, so declarations made inside it become real members of the target
2. `@pop_scope <same target>` pops back to the previous scope — it asserts (by identity) that you're popping what you actually pushed, raising instead of popping the wrong thing
3. Unlike a splat, `@push_scope` mutates its target — reopening a Type extends every instance of it, reopening a specific instance changes only that one

```code
Button {
    label := 'default'
}

@push_scope Button
    css_filter := 'invert()'   # extends the Type itself
@pop_scope Button

b := Button()
b.css_filter   # 'invert()' — every Button gets it, since Button itself was extended

@push_scope b
    onclick := { @puts 'clicked' }   # modifies just this instance
@pop_scope b

c := Button()
c.onclick   # raises Code::Undeclared_Identifier — only b was modified
```

## Arrays

1. Created with `[]` brackets
2. Access elements with subscript or dot notation

```code
arr := [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
arr[0]              # 1
arr.0               # 1 (dot notation)

arr.push(6)         # Add to end
arr.pop()           # Remove from end
arr.length()        # 5
arr.first(2)        # [1, 2]
arr.last(2)         # [4, 5]
arr.reverse()
arr.include?(3)     # true
arr.empty?()        # false

arr.map(x; x * 2)       # a lone anonymous-function argument may drop its own parens
arr.filter(x; x > 2)    # (equivalent to arr.filter((x; x > 2)))
```

## Dictionaries

1. Created with `{}` braces and key-value pairs
2. Keys can be symbols, strings, or identifiers
3. Access with subscript `dict[:key]`

```code
dict := {x: 10, y: 20}
dict[:x]            # 10
dict[:z] = 30       # Assignment

dict.keys()         # [:x, :y, :z]
dict.values()       # [10, 20, 30]
dict.has_key?(:x)   # true
dict.count()        # 3
dict.empty?()       # false
dict.delete(:z)
dict.merge({a: 1})
dict.fetch(:missing, 'default')
```

## Sets

1. An unordered collection of unique items -- no literal, build one with `Set(...)`
2. Seed it from an array, a range, or another set

```code
s := Set([1, 2, 2, 3])   # {1, 2, 3} -- dedups
s.add(4)                  # mutating methods return self, so they chain
s.include?(2)             # true
s.length()                # 4
s.values()                # [1, 2, 3, 4] -- a fresh array snapshot

Set([1, 2, 3]) | Set([3, 4])    # union          -> {1, 2, 3, 4}
Set([1, 2, 3]) & Set([2, 3, 4]) # intersection   -> {2, 3}
Set([1, 2, 3]) - Set([2, 3, 4]) # difference     -> {1}
Set([1, 2, 3]) ^ Set([2, 3, 4]) # symmetric diff -> {1, 4}

Set([1, 2]).subset?(Set([1, 2, 3]))   # true
Set([1, 2, 3]).map(n; n * 10)          # [10, 20, 30]

for Set([1, 2, 3])
    @puts it
end
```

## Strings

```code
s := 'Hello, World!'
s.length            # 13
s.0                 # 'H' (dot notation, indexes by character -- same as Array's own .0)
s.upcase()          # 'HELLO, WORLD!'
s.downcase()        # 'hello, world!'
s.split(', ')       # ['Hello', 'World!']
s.trim()            # Remove whitespace
s.chars()           # ['H', 'e', 'l', ...]
s.reverse()
s.include?('World') # true
s.start_with?('He') # true
s.end_with?('!')    # true
s.gsub('World', 'Backend')
s.to_i()            # Convert to integer
s.empty?()          # false
```

## Percent Literals

1. `%string(...)`/`%symbol(...)` turn space-separated bare items into a real Array of String/Symbol literals, preserving each item's own casing
2. `%str`/`%Str`/`%STR` force lower/Capital/UPPER casing on the strings; `%sym`/`%Sym`/`%SYM` do the same for symbols
3. Items can be identifiers, numbers, or operators, not just letters
4. Items split only on whitespace, not on punctuation — `1px` and `file.ext` each stay one item
5. A `` `expr` `` item (see Statement Expressions below) is evaluated immediately, like string interpolation, and folded through the same casing treatment as everything else

```code
%string(boo Hoo COOL)      # [boo, Hoo, COOL]
%symbol(BOO hoo Cool)      # [:BOO, :hoo, :Cool]

%str(Boo hOO COOL)         # [boo, hoo, cool]
%Str(boo HOO cOOl)         # [Boo, Hoo, Cool]
%STR(boo Hoo cool)         # [BOO, HOO, COOL]

%sym(Boo HOO cOOl)         # [:boo, :hoo, :cool]
%Sym(boo HOO cOOl)         # [:Boo, :Hoo, :Cool]
%SYM(boo Hoo cool)         # [:BOO, :HOO, :COOL]

%string(boo 4815 + - *)    # [boo, 4815, +, -, *]

cool := 2342
%string(481516 `cool`)     # [481516, 2342] -- `cool` is interpolated, not stored as-is

%string(1px solid red)     # [1px, solid, red]
%string(file.ext other)    # [file.ext, other]
```

## Statement Expressions

1. `` `expr` `` wraps any expression without running it -- an `Code::Statement`, callable later with `()`
2. Written straight at a call site, `` `expr`() `` just evaluates immediately
3. Stored in a variable, it can be called any number of times -- each call re-evaluates the wrapped expression fresh, by default remembering the scope it was *built* in (a normal closure, no matter where `()` ends up being called from)
4. `.memoize = true` caches the first call's result instead of re-running every time
5. `.use_caller_scope = true` does the opposite of remembering -- resolves fresh against wherever `()` is actually called from

```code
`1+2`()                    # 3 -- evaluated right away

x := `1+2`
x()                        # 3
x: Statement = `1+2`       # same thing, with an explicit type annotation

counter := 0
increment := `counter += 1`
increment()
increment()
increment()
counter                    # 3 -- each call actually re-ran the body

cached := `counter += 1`
cached.memoize = true
cached()                   # 4
cached()                   # 4 -- didn't run again
```

See `examples/statements.code` for the full picture, including `.use_caller_scope`.

## Numbers

`Number` is the abstract base — never instantiated directly. Each concrete type wraps a Ruby class:

| Language type | Ruby class | literal |
|---|---|---|
| `Integer` | `Integer` | `4` |
| `Float` | `Float` | `4.5` |
| `Decimal` | `BigDecimal` | none — `Decimal('1.50')` / `Decimal(x)` only |
| `Number` | — (base) | — |

`Int`, `Flo`, and `Dec` are short aliases for `Integer`, `Float`, and `Decimal` — `4 === Int` and `4 === Integer` are both true, since an alias is the exact same type, not a subtype.

```code
n := 42
n.abs()             # Absolute value
n.floor()           # Round down
n.ceil()            # Round up
n.round()           # Round to nearest
n.sqrt()            # Square root
n.even?()           # true
n.odd?()            # false
n.to_s()            # '42'
n.clamp(0, 100)     # Clamp to range
```

## Dates & Times

`Date`, `Time`, and `Date_Time` are always available -- no `@load`.

```code
Date.today()                # today
Date.parse('2020-03-15')
Time.now()
Time.at(1_700_000_000)      # from epoch seconds
Date_Time.now()
Date_Time.parse('2020-03-15T09:30:00+00:00')

d := Date.parse('2020-03-15')
d.year         # 2020
d.month        # 3
d.day          # 15
d.weekday      # 0   (0 = Sunday .. 6 = Saturday; Date only)
d.iso8601()    # '2020-03-15'

Time.now().epoch()   # Unix seconds (Time only)

Date.parse('2020-01-01') < Date.parse('2021-01-01')   # true -- all of < > <= >= == != work
```

`Time` and `Date_Time` also have `.hour`, `.minute`, `.second`.

## Ranges

Base is two dots `..`; the others add a `<` or `>` to trim an end. (`...` is not a range operator — it's the variadic-param sugar.)

1. `..` inclusive range
2. `..<` exclusive end
3. `>..` exclusive start
4. `>..<` exclusive both

```code
1..5    #   1, 2, 3, 4, 5    (inclusive)
1..<5   #   1, 2, 3, 4       (exclusive end)
1>..5   #      2, 3, 4, 5    (exclusive start)
1>..<5  #      2, 3, 4       (exclusive both)

for 1..10
    @puts it
end
```

A range is a real value with its own methods:

```code
r := 1..5
r.start()          # 1
r.finish()         # 5
r.length()         # 5
r.include?(3)      # true
r.to_a()           # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
r.sum()            # 15
r.map(n; n * n)             # [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
r.filter(n; n % 2 == 0)     # [2, 4]

x: Range = 1..5    # a `: Range` contract holds
1..5 === Range     # true
```

A range also works as an Array or String subscript — each operator keeps its own end/start rule, so `[1..3]` is one element longer than `[1..<3]`. Endless and beginless forms slice too; a negative endpoint counts from the end:

```code
xs := [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
xs[1..3]     # [20, 30, 40]      inclusive
xs[1..<3]    # [20, 30]          exclusive end
xs[2..]      # [30, 40, 50]      endless
xs[..3]      # [10, 20, 30, 40]  beginless
xs[..-1]     # [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]   -1 is the last index
"abcdef"[0..<2]   # 'ab'
```

## File & Dir

```code
content := File.read('./file.txt')
File.write_string_to_file('./out.txt', 'Hello!')
File.list_directory('./src')          # sorted child names

d := Dir('./src')
d.children()     # full paths of every child
d.subdirs()      # child directories, as paths
d.files()        # child files, as paths
d.size()         # recursive total bytes
d.size_of(path)  # one file's bytes, or one dir's recursive total
Dir.pwd()        # -> Dir
```

Both are always loaded — no `@load`.

## The Context (`@`)

`@` is the current scope's *context* — reflective facts about wherever it's written, plus a set of built-in functions. Every scope has one: Global, a Type, an instance, a function body. The functions live on one shared context; the facts are computed on demand against the scope you reach `@` from. There's no separate "directive" concept — `@word` is just `@.word`.

```code
@ === Context      # true
@.name             # 'Global' at the top level
@.to_s()           # '@Global'
```

`@word` is shorthand for `@.word` — `@name` is `@.name`, and `@puts x` / `@load 'f'` call a function member.

### Reflective vitals

Read-only facts about the scope, computed live on every access — read `@.name` again after a retag and it reflects the change:

```code
Flying { airborne := true }
Duck | Flying {}

Duck.@name              # 'Duck'
Duck.@composed_types    # Set{'Duck', 'Flying'} — own name plus every |/&/~/^ type
Duck.@object_id         # the plain Ruby number

[1, 2, 3].@type         # 'Array' — @type / @types read on any value
nil.@type               # 'Nil'
```

Reflection lives on `@` only. Plain `.` is reserved for a scope's own members, so a struct member named `name` or `types` never collides with the reflective accessor of the same name:

```code
Row <name: String, types: Number>
r := Row('cooper', 3)

r.name         # 'cooper'        — the member
r.@name        # 'Row'           — the struct's identifier
r.@type_names  # ['String', 'Number']
r.@names       # ['name', 'types']
```

### Function members

`@puts`, `@assert`, `@refute`, `@sleep`, `@load`, `@declare`, `@push_scope` / `@pop_scope`, `@connect`, `@start_server` / `@stop_server`, and the scope functions `@splat` / `@splatr` / `@unsplat` all live on the context. A bare `@puts` (no call) is the function itself, so it can be captured:

```code
kept := @puts('logged')   # prints 'logged', returns it unchanged (a passthrough)
p := @puts
p('again')                # 'again'
```

### Your own `@` members on a Type

Inside a `Type { }` body you can hang your own members off the type's context. They show up under `@`, never in plain `.` access, so they can't collide with the type's real members. A built-in name (`@name`, `@types`, ...) is reserved and raises.

```code
Widget {
    @version := 2
    @author: String = 'me'

    stamp (; "widget v`@version` by `@author`" )
}

Widget.@version   # 2
w := Widget()
w.@version        # 2 — an instance reads through to its type's context
```

## @load

1. Imports another Code file
2. A file is only run once per scope it's loaded into — loading the same file into the same scope again returns the first run's result instead of re-running it
3. Imports may be scoped by assigning the @load to a variable
4. The path can also be written bare (unquoted), as long as it starts with `./`, `../`, or `~/` — a `\ ` pair escapes a literal space, the same way a shell's own tab-completion writes one

```code
@load 'programs/string.code'
@load 'programs/array.code'
@load './my_module.code'
my_mod := @load './my_module.code'
my_mod.Some_Type()

@load './my_module.code'   # already loaded into this scope -- returns the same result again, doesn't re-run

@load ../shared/thing.code
@load ~/.config/backend/init.code
@load ./tools/blah\ blah/hello.code   # -> tools/blah blah/hello.code

@load asdf/asdf.code   # NOT a bare path -- no leading ./, ../, or ~/, so this parses as ordinary
                        # division (asdf / asdf . code) same as it always has
```

This genuinely behaves like a shell's own `.`/`..`/`~` — `./x` and `../x` resolve against the current directory, `~/x` against your home directory, and `../../x` climbs multiple levels correctly, the same as `cd ../..`. Two things to know:

- "Current directory" means wherever you *ran* `bin/prog` from — not the folder the `.code` file with the `@load` line lives in. That matches a shell's own relative arguments (always resolved against your shell's cwd, never the command's own location), so it's consistent with terminal habits, just worth remembering it's "relative to where you launched from," not "relative to this file."
- Only the current user's `~/` is supported — a real shell's `~otheruser/path` (someone else's home directory) isn't recognized as a bare path at all.

## @puts

```code
@puts 'Hello, World!'
@puts variable
@puts "Value: `expression`"
```

`@puts` is a passthrough: it prints, then returns the original value unchanged, so it can sit inline anywhere an expression is expected:

```code
double ( n; n * 2 )
double(@puts 5)   # prints 5, returns 10 -- the call still gets the real 5
```

### Telling printed values apart

Code's built-in collection types each wrap their printed contents in a different bracket, so you can tell what you're looking at at a glance:

```code
@puts [1, 2, 3]      # [1, 2, 3]      -- Array
@puts (1, 2, 3)      # (1, 2, 3)      -- Tuple
@puts {x: 1, y: 2}   # {x: 1, y: 2}   -- Dictionary
@puts <1, 2, 3>      # <1, 2, 3>      -- Struct
```

A custom type prints as raw internals until it defines its own `to_s(;)` — see [Classes](#classes):

```code
Point {
    x := 1
    greet (; 'hi' )
}
@puts Point()   # #<Code::Instance name="Point" declarations=["x", "greet"]>
```

Nothing enforces a bracket convention for your own types, but picking one that doesn't collide with the built-ins above keeps output easy to scan.

## @declare

1. Declares an identifier on the current scope from a runtime String name, rather than a literal identifier written in the source (what `:=` needs)
2. `@declare name` declares `nil`; `@declare name, value` and `@declare name, value, type` add a value and, optionally, a type
3. Passed a Struct instead of a name, spreads every *named* member onto the current scope in one go — each member's own name, value, and declared type carry over directly

```code
@declare 'flare_count'          # flare_count == nil
@declare 'flare_count', 3       # flare_count == 3
@declare 'ration', 2, Number    # same as `ration: Number = 2`

supplies := <water: Number = 40, wood: Number = 12>
@declare supplies               # water == 40, wood == 12
```

## Web Server

1. Compose with `Server` type
2. Define routes with HTTP method syntax
3. Boot with `@start_server` (background thread; `@stop_server` to shut one down)

```code
@load 'programs/server.code'

App | Server {
    Self (;
        self.port = 3000
    )

    get:// (;
        'Hello, World!'
    )

    get://about (;
        'About page'
    )
}

@start_server App()
```

## Routes

1. HTTP methods: `get://`, `post://`, `put://`, `delete://`, `patch://`
2. URL parameters with `:param` syntax
3. Query params via `request.query`

```code
App | Server {
    # Static route
    get://users (;
        'All users'
    )

    # URL parameter
    get://users/:id ( id;
        "User `id`"
    )

    # Multiple params
    get://posts/:post_id/comments/:id ( post_id, id;
        "Comment `id` on post `post_id`"
    )

    # Query strings: /search?q=term
    get://search (;
        query := request.query[:q]
        "Searching for `query`"
    )
}
```

## Request & Response

```code
post://login (;
    username := request.body[:username]
    password := request.body[:password]

    if authenticate(username, password)
        response.redirect('/dashboard')
    else
        response.status = 401
        'Unauthorized'
    end
)

get://api/data (;
    response.headers['Content-Type'] = 'application/json'
    '{"status": "ok"}'
)
```

## Database

1. `@load 'programs/database.code'` -- this pulls in `programs/table.code` too
2. `Sqlite(url)` builds a database; `@connect` opens it and **returns it**
3. `Sqlite.memory()` for an in-memory db, `Sqlite.local('a/path.db')` for a file at that path verbatim -- the parent directory has to already exist

```code
@load 'programs/database.code'

db := @connect Sqlite('./data/app.db')
```

A schema is a **named Struct** -- one member per column, its type deciding the column type. The table name comes from the struct's name (`User` -> `users`), so the struct has to be named.

```code
User <
    id: Primary_Key
    name: String
    email: String
    joined_at: Date_Time
>

db.find_or_create_table(User)   # -> a Table (creates it if missing)
db.table_exists?(User)          # true          (also takes a bare :users)
db.tables()                     # [users]  -- Symbols
db.find_table('users')          # -> a Table, or nil
db.delete_table!(User)          # also takes a bare :users
```

Column types: `Primary_Key`, `String`/`Text`, `Int`, `Number`, `Bool`, `Date`, `Time`, `Date_Time`. `Flo`/`Decimal`/`Blob` are mapped but not backed by a Code type yet.

## Record ORM

`db.find_or_create_table(schema)` returns a `Table`. CRUD lives on that object -- no model composition, no statics.

```code
users := db.find_or_create_table(User)

cooper := users.create(<name := 'Cooper'>)   # attrs are a `:=`-member Struct
users.create(<name := 'Luna'>)

users.all()                       # Array of record Structs
users.find(cooper.id)             # one record Struct, or nil
users.find_by(<name := 'Luna'>)   # first match, or nil
users.where(<name := 'Luna'>)     # Array of matches
users.update(cooper.id, <name := 'Cooper II'>)
users.delete(cooper.id)
users.count()
```

- A record is a `Struct` named after the schema -- read members by name (`record.name`), or `record.to_h` for the whole row
- `Bool` columns round-trip as real `true`/`false`; `Date`/`Time`/`Date_Time` columns round-trip as the matching wrapper (`record.joined_at.year`)
- A filter naming a column the schema doesn't have raises `Code::Table_Invalid_Filter_Column`

## HTML Elements

1. Compose with HTML element types from `programs/html.code`
2. `css_*` prefix sets inline CSS properties
3. `html_*` prefix sets HTML attributes
4. `.to_s()` renders an element and its children to string directly

```code
@load 'programs/html.code'

Card | Div {
    css_padding := '1rem'
    css_border_radius := '8px'
    css_background_color := '#fff'

    html_class := 'card'
    html_data_value := 42
    html_aria_label,
}

Link | A {
    html_href = '#'
    html_target := '_blank'
}

page := Html([
    Head(Title('My Page'))
    Body([
        H1('Welcome')
        Card([
            P('Hello!')
            Link('Click me')
        ])
    ])
])
```

## CSS

1. `@load 'programs/css.code'` -- CSS is plain data: `Property`/`Style_Rule`/`At_Rule`/`Scope_Rule`/`Custom_Property_Rule`/`Layer_Order`/`Keyframe`/`Variable_Declaration`/`Css_Function`/`Color` are all bare structs, no parser involved
2. `Css_Formatter_Visitor` walks a tree of those structs and turns it into a real CSS string -- pretty by default, `minify := true` for one line
3. A rule nested inside another rule's own `rules` gets a synthesized `&` prefix (real CSS nesting); a rule merely sitting inside an `At_Rule`/`Scope_Rule` body does not, since there's no parent selector for `&` to refer to there
4. `Css_Lint_Visitor` walks the same kind of tree checking for duplicate properties, hardcoded vendor prefixes, and redundant zero-units (`0px` -> `0`) instead of formatting it. Handed a whole `Stylesheet`, it also warns when a state rule (`.card:hover`, `:focus`, ...) sets `transform` while the base selector runs a keyframe `animation` that also animates `transform` — the running animation recomputes it every frame, so the hover value never shows

```code
@load 'programs/css.code'

rule := Style_Rule(['.card'], [Property('color', 'red'), Property('padding', '8px')])

Css_Formatter_Visitor().format(rule)
# ".card {\n    color: red;\n    padding: 8px;\n}"

Css_Formatter_Visitor(minify := true).format(rule)
# ".card{color:red;padding:8px;}"

Css_Lint_Visitor().lint(Style_Rule(['.a'], [Property('color', 'red'), Property('color', 'blue')]))
# ["Duplicate property 'color'"]
```

## Struct-Based HTML

1. `@load 'programs/html2.code'` -- same spirit as CSS above: `Element <tag, attributes: Array\Attribute, css: Css, children>` is the one node shape, and lowercase constructors (`div`, `p`, `h1`, ...) build it. Coexists with `programs/html.code`'s `Dom` types above rather than replacing them -- this one only builds an HTML string, it doesn't hook into the server's live-render pipeline (onclick wiring, `dom.js`)
2. `attributes` is an ordered `Array\Attribute` (`Attribute(name, value)`, built the same way `Property` builds a CSS declaration) -- not a Dictionary, so attributes keep their given order and can even collide (see `Html_Lint_Visitor` below)
3. `css` takes any css.code struct directly -- `Html_Formatter_Visitor` renders it as one more child, an embedded `<style>` block, wherever it's attached
4. `Html_Render`/`Html_Format` are two shared `Html_Formatter_Visitor` instances (compact/pretty); void tags (`br`, `img`, `input`, ...) never get a closing tag in either mode
5. `Html_Stats_Visitor` (node count, depth, unique tags), `Html_Sanitizer_Visitor` (strips `script`/`iframe`/`object`/`embed` and `on*`/`javascript:` attributes), and `Html_Lint_Visitor` (void element given children, `<img>` missing `alt`, empty containers, duplicate attribute names) walk the same tree for their own purposes -- `Html_Lint_Visitor` and `Css_Lint_Visitor` both compose `programs/visitor.code`'s `Warnings_Visitor` mixin for their shared `warnings`/`warn` machinery

```code
@load 'programs/html2.code'
@load 'programs/css.code'

page := div([
    h1('Welcome'),
    p('Hello!', [Attribute('class', 'greeting')])
], [], Style_Rule(['.greeting'], [Property('color', 'blue')]))

Html_Render.render(page)
# '<div><h1>Welcome</h1><p class="greeting">Hello!</p><style>.greeting{color:blue;}</style></div>'
```

## Operators

### Arithmetic

```code
+ - * / %     # Basic math
**            # Exponentiation
<< >>         # Bitwise shift / Array append
```

### Comparison

```code
== !=             # Equality
< <= > >=         # Relational
<=>               # Spaceship (three-way)
=~ !~             # Regex match
=== =!=           # Composed-type-set equality
=>= =<=           # Composed-type-set superset (and its mirror) =>= means "left superset of right?", and its mirror
=/=               # Composed-type-set disjointness means they don't share anything
```

`===`, `=!=`, `=>=`, `=<=`, and `=/=` compare a type or instance's *composed types* — its own name plus everything it's picked up via `|`/`&`/`~`/`^` — rather than comparing values:

```code
Flying { can_fly := true }
Swimming { can_swim := true }

Duck | Flying | Swimming { name := 'duck' }
Fish | Swimming { name := 'fish' }

Duck === Duck          # true  (identical composed types)
Duck === Fish          # false (Duck also composes Flying)
Duck =!= Fish          # true

Duck =>= Swimming      # true  (Duck composes with at least Swimming)
Swimming =>= Duck      # false
Swimming =<= Duck      # true  (=<= is =>= with the operands flipped)

Duck =/= Fish          # false (both compose Swimming — not disjoint)
Flying =/= Swimming    # true  (share nothing)
```

All five comparison operators also take [Structs](#structs) into account. An untagged type is treated as having no members, so plain comparisons like the ones above are unaffected:

```code
Abc\<Number> {}
Abc\<Number> === Abc\<String>   # false — same composed type, different tag
Abc === Abc                     # true  — neither side tagged
```

`Any` is a universal wildcard for `==`/`!=`/`=>=`/`=<=`/`=/=`: anything that isn't `nil` counts as equal (or a superset of/never-disjoint-from) it, no composition needed. `===`/`=!=` are the deliberate exception — they're exact type-set equality, which is what code uses as a structural "is this really an X" check, so a bare `Any` value only matches `Any` itself there, not everything.

```code
String == Any     # true
4 == Any          # true
nil == Any        # false — the one exception
String =>= Any    # true — Any really is a superset of everything

String === Any    # false — === doesn't wildcard; neither composes the other
Any === Any       # true
```

A String compares equal (`==`/`!=` only) to a bare Type whose `@name` it spells — so a collection of type-name strings can be scanned with a real type:

```code
Flying { can_fly := true }
Duck | Flying {}

"Flying" == Flying                       # true
Duck.@composed_types.include?(Flying)    # true — the set holds the string 'Flying'
```

### Logical

```code
&& and        # Logical AND
|| or         # Logical OR
! not         # Logical NOT
```

### Assignment

```code
:=            # Declaration — introduces a new identifier, infers and locks its type
=             # Assignment — requires the identifier to already be declared
+= -= *= /=   # Compound assignment
&&= ||=       # Logical compound
<<= >>=       # Shift compound
```

## Operator Overloading

1. Declare with `@operator`, a symbol or identifier, a fixity (`@infix`, `@prefix`, `@postfix`), a precedence number, and a function body
2. Overloads are stored as regular functions in the declaring scope, so they can be scoped to a single function without leaking out
3. Precedence controls how overloaded operators combine with each other and with built-ins
4. If a type declares its own overload for an operator, that always wins over a same-named overload declared elsewhere — dispatch is by the left operand's type first, falling back to whatever's in scope only if the operand doesn't have its own

```code
# Redefine + only inside this function — everywhere else, + still adds
scoped := compute (;
    @operator + @infix 700 ( left, right;
        left * right
    )
    3 + 4
)

3 + 4      # 7 (unaffected outside)
scoped()   # 12

# Build a pipeline operator
@operator -> @infix 300 ( left, right;
    right(left)
)

double ( n; n * 2 )
add_fifteen ( n; n + 15 )

4 -> double -> add_fifteen  # 23

# Invent new literal syntax
Time { hour, minute, period, }

@operator : @infix 700 ( hour, minute;
    t := Time()
    t.hour = hour
    t.minute = minute
    t
)

@operator pm @postfix 600 ( left: Time;
    left.period = 'pm'
    left
)

11:22pm  # Time(hour: 11, minute: 22, period: 'pm')

# Or a prefix operator that builds a value from a bare literal
Currency { amount, name, code, }

@operator $ @prefix 900 ( amount;
    c := Currency()
    c.amount = amount
    c.name = 'US Dollar'
    c.code = 'USD'
    c
)

$42  # Currency(amount: 42, name: 'US Dollar', code: 'USD')

# A type's own overload beats a same-named global one. A fresh symbol (~>, not ->) since
# declaring another global -> here would just overwrite the pipeline -> declared above it,
# in the same global scope.
@operator ~> @infix 300 ( left, right; 999 )

Wrapped {
    val,
    Self ( v; self.val = v )
    @operator ~> @infix 300 ( left, right; left.val )
}

a := Wrapped(42)
a ~> 1          # 42 — Wrapped's own ~> wins
5 ~> double     # 999 — global ~> still applies to everything else
```

## Runtime Type Contracts

1. `:=` infers a type from its right-hand side and locks the identifier to it
2. Subsequent `=` assignments are checked against that locked type; `:=` again re-infers and re-locks
3. A mismatch raises `Code::Type_Contract_Violation`, not the static type checker's `Type_Mismatch`

```code
x := 4        # declares x, infers Number, locks x to that type
x = 8         # ok — same type
x = 'hello'   # raises Code::Type_Contract_Violation ("expected Number, got String")

x := 4
x := 'hello'  # fine — re-declaring with := re-infers and re-locks the type
x             # 'hello'

y = 4         # raises Code::Cannot_Assign_Undeclared_Identifier — y was never declared
```

A `: Type` annotation can list more than one alternative type, joined by `|`, `&`, `^`, or `~` — all four mean the exact same thing here: the value must match at least one of the listed types (OR). The operator's usual [type composition](#type-composition) meaning (merge, keep-shared, remove, keep-unique) does not apply to a type annotation — an annotation only lists names to check against, it does not build a new composed type.

```code
x: Int | Nil = 1     # ok — matches Int
x: Int & Nil = nil   # ok — matches Nil (& means the same OR check as | here)
x: Int ^ Nil = true  # raises Code::Type_Contract_Violation — matches neither Int nor Nil
x: Int ~ Nil = true  # same violation — ~ means the same OR check too
```

This holds everywhere a `: Type` annotation appears: a first assignment, a later reassignment against an already-locked type, a function's own return type (`-> Type`, see [Function Signatures](#function-signatures)), and a destructuring target's own `: Type`.

Declaring the combined type first and annotating with its name does *not* give you a reusable version of this OR check:

```code
Int_Or_Nil | Int | Nil {}
x: Int_Or_Nil = 4     # raises Code::Type_Contract_Violation, even though 4 is an Int
```

A single named type in annotation position checks the value against that *one* type — real is-a matching, not "matches one of the types it was composed from". So `Int_Or_Nil` only ever accepts `nil` (matching by name is trivial there) or an actual `Int_Or_Nil()` value, never a plain `Int` on its own. Spell out `x: Int | Nil` at each spot you need it — there's no reusable named stand-in for "one of these types" today.

Declaring a combined type first *is* the right move for the other direction — a value that must actually be, or extend, that whole combined type:

```code
Combined | A | B {}
c := Combined()
x: Combined = c    # ok — c really is a Combined
```

## Function Signatures

1. `(Param, Param -> Type;)` is a signature — a value describing a function's shape (its param types and return type), with no implementation — same `-> Type` placement a real function uses, just with no body
2. A real function always declares its own return type inside its body, with `-> Type` at the end of its param list before `;` — a self-declaring signature uses the same shape under its name (`double: (Number -> Number;)`)
3. Assigning a function to a signature-typed identifier checks its actual shape, not just a name — mismatches raise `Code::Type_Contract_Violation`, the same runtime type contract `:=` uses
4. Any function with a declared return type is checked on every call — what it actually returns has to match, signature or not

```code
Currency_Formatter := (Number -> String;)    # takes a Number, returns a String

format_usd ( cents: Number -> String;
    "$" + (cents / 100.0).to_s()
)

format_eur ( cents: Number -> String;
    "€" + (cents / 100.0).to_s()
)

formatter: Currency_Formatter = format_usd
formatter(1050)               # "$10.5"

formatter = format_eur        # ok — same shape: (Number) -> String
formatter(1050)               # "€10.5"

formatter = ( cents; cents )  # raises Code::Type_Contract_Violation — wrong shape
```

A declared return type is enforced on its own, with no signature involved:

```code
lying ( a -> Number; 'not a number' )
lying(5)   # raises Code::Type_Contract_Violation — declared Number, actually returned String
```

## Structs

1. `<...>` attaches runtime-inspectable metadata (a struct) to a standalone value. Tagging a *Type* declaration/reference itself uses `\` instead, to stay unambiguous with a plain struct value and with comparisons — `Array\<String> {}` (inline literal), `Array\Task_Schema {}`/`Array\String {}` (a named reference to an already-declared struct or Type), `Primary_Key\4815` (a bare integer, a "version tag")
2. `\` chains: `Thing\One\Two {}` tags `Thing` with `One`, which is itself tagged with `Two`. `.tag` is `One`, `.tag.tag` is `Two`
3. Each declared tag is its own type — `Abc\<Number> {}` and `Abc\<String> {}` don't share `Self`/methods, and `Thing\One\Two` and `Thing\One\Three` are distinct too
4. A reference matches a declared tag by type (like overload resolution), including types it composes and not just its own name, at every link of the chain. Referencing a real Type with no matching variant yet auto-declares one; referencing anything else with no match raises `Code::Undeclared_Tagged_Type`
5. Reachable through `.tag` (`.tag.types`, or `.tag.some_name` for named members) — bound before `Self(;)` runs, never forwarded as constructor args
6. `x.tag = new_tag` re-tags at runtime, but only on a value whose type was declared with a tag, and only when `new_tag` composes at least everything the current tag does, at every chain link (`=>=`) — otherwise `Code::Tag_Signature_Violation`
7. Naming an *undeclared* identifier with bare `<...>` (no `\`, e.g. `Named<...>`) builds a plain, named struct instead of raising — a name that's already taken by a real Type still takes priority and behaves as above
8. A bare named struct's member can be annotated with the struct's own name (`Node <name: String, parent: Node>`) — and two structs can reference each other. An empty `Name <>` is a forward declaration a later `Name <...>` fills in; redeclaring an already-filled struct with a *different* shape raises `Code::Undeclared_Tagged_Type`

```code
String\<dict: Dictionary> {
    to_s (; "dict: `tag.dict`" )
}
String\<num: Number> {
    to_s (; "number: `tag.num`" )
}

String\<{x=1}>().to_s()   # "dict: {x: 1}"
String\<5>().to_s()       # "number: 5"

Format_A {} Format_B {} Format_C {}
Payload\Format_A\Format_B\Format_C {
    trace (; [self.tag.@type_names.0, self.tag.tag.@type_names.0, self.tag.tag.tag.@type_names.0] )
}
Payload\Format_A\Format_B\Format_C().trace()   # ['Format_A', 'Format_B', 'Format_C']

Thing := <String, Number>   # anonymous struct -- @.name is nil
n := Named<String, Number>  # bare <...>, no `\` -- Named is undeclared, so this builds a plain named struct instead
n.@name                     # 'Named'

Tree <
    value: Number
    children: Array
    parent: Tree             # a member typed with the struct's own name
>
```

## Enums (not finalized — don't rely on yet)

```code
Task_Type [
	TODO
	BUG,
	DONE: Priority             # type-annotated -- still Symbol-valued, annotation is metadata only
	CANCELLED: Priority = 99   # type-annotated with an explicit value
	ARCHIVED := 'archived'     # self-declared value, no annotation
]

Task_Type.TODO      # :TODO         -- a member value is a plain `.` access
Task_Type.@keys     # [TODO, BUG, DONE, CANCELLED, ARCHIVED]   -- reflective data is `@`-only
Task_Type.@count    # 5
```

Self-declaring, like `Type { }` and a named `func (;)` — no `:=`. `Name [ ... ]` is an enum when the brackets hold a comma, two-plus items, a member form, or nothing; a lone bare item (`Name [ ONE ]`) reads as an ordinary subscript instead. Force a one-option enum with a trailing comma or an annotation:

```code
Suit [ HEARTS DIAMONDS CLUBS SPADES ]   # space-separated is fine
Solo [ ONLY, ]                          # trailing comma -- a one-option enum
Level: Enum\Int [ LOW, HIGH ]           # annotated: always an enum; Int is the backing type
Level: Int [ LOW, HIGH ]                # same -- the backing type on its own, no `Enum\`
```

Enums are syntactically present but not finalized: each member's `: Type` annotation and the backing type are parsed and stored, but not enforced — nothing raises if a value doesn't match. The older forced-type spelling (`TYPE_IDENT :: Type { ... }`) no longer exists. Don't rely on Enum type-checking yet.

## Shorthand Nil-Initialization

Trailing comma declares variable as nil if undefined. 

```code
Type {
	undefined_var,      # equivalent to `undefined_var := nil`	
}

here_too,               # here_too := nil
```

A bare annotated identifier with nothing assigned behaves the same way — no need to write `= nil` just to make an already-self-declaring annotation (`x: Number`, or a struct annotation) actually declare something:

```code
thing: <String, Number>   # same as thing: <String, Number> = nil
thing                     # nil

x: Number                 # same as x: Number = nil
x                         # nil
```
