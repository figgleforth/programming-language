After much trouble trying to parse conditional if `xyz {}` vs `member {}` vs `{ dict_key }', I now know there's too much ambiguity here. I need to redesign this syntax so each construct is easily identifiable by its tokens. That would really make it a lot easier to parse.
So what's more important? member {} or if xyz {}?
I could make arrows mandatory for functions, so then they cannot be confused with the conditional braces since those will not have the arrow
But then what about dictionaries? { x=1 } is valid, but it's with the -> requirement it won't ever be confused for a block.
if abc {
	x = 1
}
The only ambiguity remaining is that {x=1} could be a dictionary. If I make dictionary only work with colon, then this should be fine? Possibly?
if abc {
	x: 1
} # I find it hard to believe this would ever happen. It would have to be some kind of syntax error in this case.
Or what if I make dictionaries require %d{}? That might be overkill, I might hate working with dictionaries then

- #make_ast currently lump ident { and ident = together. those need to be separate.

Interpreting issue when calling .member on a Class_Construct. I think to fix this, parse for class methods [self, '.', identifier ... func] and add those to the scope
Abc { what { 123 }}.what
◼︎ undefined variable or function `what` in Abc scope
Abc { what { 123 }}.new.what
◼︎ 123

Figure out Class_Construct. How is that used to initialize an instance? See Interpreter#evaluate when Class_Expr

Two identifier expressions are valid syntax. For example, `ab = 12 cd = 34` evaluates to 12. This might involve lexing whitespace again? I'm not really sure

Interpreter issue: Looks like params are not declared in the scope of the block
x { in -> in }
◼︎ #<Block_Construct:0x0000000103f2c110>
x()
◼︎ undefined variable or function `in` in  scope

Interpreter class is becoming very messy. Cleanup.

Scope depth when reaches the 70s. Is that wrong? It feels wrong. That means I'm constantly pushing scope, but not popping? I wonder if it has something to do with how I'm currently re-evaluating the expression that was used as an argument. So Boo.new is evaluated, then during composition it's expression is re-evaluated to add its guts to the current scope.
Here's the example program
Boo { scary = true }
moo { boo -> boo.scary }
moo(Boo.new)
moo_with_comp { &boo_param -> scary }
moo_with_comp(Boo.new)
^ this turned out to be the number of scopes instantiated, rather than actual depth. I made #push_scope set the depth to number of scopes + 1
